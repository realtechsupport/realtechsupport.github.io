	<h2>Make Language, 2005-2009</h2>
	<h3><i>synthetic accents - robot normalization</i></h3>
  <br>

        <p>
						  MakeLanguage is a trilogy on the 'arrival' of synthetic spoken language produced from text by computers
						 (text-to-speech or TTS) in everyday life. The project began around 2004, as desktop dictation and navigation
						  systems with computer generated voices entered the global market place.
				</p>
        <p>
						  MakeLanguage - SyntheticAccents queries the altered position of identity introduced by synthetic speech in daily life
						  with a speculative robotic intervention. The project enters this territory by reconfiguring the internal language
							parameters and procedures of a high end speech engine, and bending them to produce spoken language artifacts that
							the system was never designed to produce.
				</p>
        <p>
							Digital signal processing can create arbitrary signals, most of which have no relationship to those human beings
							are capable of uttering. Despite the universality of the technical infrastructure, TTS systems are usually designed
							along national fault lines with localized voice fonts and linguistically identifiable entities; there are Sarahs for
							US English, Heathers for UK English, and G&#252;nthers for German. It comes as no surprise that commercial TTS systems
							do not offer speech products with 'undesirable' features such as slurred speech or strong accents.
							Synthetic voices are normalized, invoking through the proficiency of the machine an idealized human being.
				</p>
        <p>
							In humans, accents are an audible map of a life lived. In machines, accented speech creates the illusion of a human
							with a story. MakeLanguage - SyntheticAccents creates accented Englisch (Frenglisch, Genglisch and Spanglisch accents
							in limited vocabularies) to speculate upon the imagined lives of these accents without origins. To me, these voices
							seem most  appropriate for what the French anthropologist Marc Aug&eacute; called non-lieux (non-places). The endless hallways
							of airports, research labs, and the empty rooms of convention centers become even more unbearable when they are
							augmented by synthetic accents.

        Examples
    
				<br><br>
			  A synthetic German-English accent <a href="/sounds/o_planets.wav"> <u>counting the planets of our solar system (and making a mistake).</u></a>
        <br><br>
        A synthetic Spanish-English accent <a href="/sounds/s_accent.wav"><u>announcing a flight at an airport.</u></a>
