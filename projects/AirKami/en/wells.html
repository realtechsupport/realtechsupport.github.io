            <p>Our survey area in Terban consists of 13 water wells and one site by the river Code. Of the 14 test sites, eight are private and six are public.
              Only sites that had been chlorinated were contamination free. All other sites showed significant levels of E.coli and total coliforms.</p>

				rev="Private wells are part of houses built on private land and only accessible to others by permission of the owner.
        In practice, water from private wells are often shared amongst neighbors. The terms ‘private’ and ‘public’ are imprecise as the interpretation
        of the private and public realms are particular to the Indonesian context."></a>

				rev="Some wells are 17meters deep while others are only 3 meters deep. Some wells have electric pumps while others only a manual pulley system.
        Public wells are often deeper than private wells and tap into higher quality water sources."></a>

				rev="Public wells are wells located on Terban district land, cared for by a group of inhabitants, accessible by all, but in practice used by a few
        families in the immediate vicinity of the well. Use of public wells is not restricted for locals. However, use is based on first come first serve principle,
        and requires that one follow the rules of public well use. These rules include, for example, refraining from personal hygiene activities close to wells used for drinking."></a>

				rev="Airkami posted all its results on line as soon as they became available. The state lab that is charged with testing water wells does not share the data it collects.
        Only sites that had been chlorinated were contamination free. All other sites showed significant levels of E.coli and total coliforms.
        A notable exception is the new site 15, the WaterBank."></a>
