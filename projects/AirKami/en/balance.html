				rev="WaterBank can produce up to 400 liters of water per day. The community members (PKK) managing WaterBank have set the cost of one canister (19 liters) at 4000 Rupiah, about $0.4. The water is free of fecal contamination and recognized by Terban inhabitants as the best water in the vicinity. And every time someone fills up a canister of water, the fishpond gets its share of fresh water as well. WaterBank sells about 10 canisters of water a day, and even has regular customers. Proceeds from sales cover the cost of electricity required to run the system."></a>
