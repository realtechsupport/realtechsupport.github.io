            <p>Biosensing is the science and art of using biological materials to monitor the presence of chemicals. Due to advances in device manufacturing and sensor integration, biosensing is becoming as quotidian as older and less spectacular body metric systems. There is an ongoing debate as to how best to make use of biosensing, and this project contributes in new ways to the inquiry.  Airkami created a robust biosensing-enabled system designed to deal with the infrastructure constraints of daily life in Yogyakarta. But biosensing in the tropics has its very own challenges. </p>

        This local institution is at the center of government supported health care efforts, and so Airkami was integrated into the Puskesmas.
        Increasingly, water born diseases are making Terban residents frail and vulnerable.
        Because coliforms are understood generally as indicators of a wide array of pathogens that adversely impact human beings, Airkami monitors specifically coliform presence in water wells.">

				rev="Airkami incorporates the Veolia Endetec B-16 system for coliform detection. The B-16 is an optical biosensor that detects the florescent enzyme activity of target bacteria in a custom designed growth medium.
        The system is capable of detecting coliforms down to the single colony level within 16 hours. The duration of the analysis depends on the concentration of contamination,
        with higher levels leading to much quicker responses."></a>

        to a local server (the house of public data) whenever connectivity allows for the data transfer. From there the data is passed to a remote server for backup storage, and analysis.
        Email messages are sent from the remote server to Puskesmas Staff. "></a>

				<a href="../images/airkamiphotos/equipment.jpg" rel="shadowbox[terban]"

         We call that server the House of Public Data as data stored on it is available to the public."></a>

				<a href="../images/airkamiphotos/B16.jpg"  rel="shadowbox[terban]"
				rev="The B-16 system is particularly interesting as it breaks down the barrier to top-down, expert only water quality control, offering quick results without the need for a microbiologist.
        As such it is part of the rapidly changing landscape of once exclusive biomonitoring systems now in the hands of non-professionals.
        Particularly when combined with open-source software, biosensing enabled IT can impact biomonitoring and biopolitics."></a>

				rev="Airkami uses a pro-sumer grade weather station to capture wind, wind gust, wind direction, rain, rain rate and humidity data throughout the rainy and dry seasons.
        As our data show, rain and dry seasons effect the water supply in a variety of ways. This complementary sensing system allows us to consider dependencies between expensive
        biosensing and cheap, but readily available parameters such as rainfall and well water levels."></a>
