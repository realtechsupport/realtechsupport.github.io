            <p>Water is a premium resource in Terban. Given the compromised water conditions and the lack of alternatives, the Terban inhabitants have developed an operational relationship with ‘dirty waters’. There is considerable improvisation (and lack of foresight) in the use of the available water resources. While rain water is a viable drinking water source, there is never enough to last through the dry season. Inhabitants who can not afford bottled water use shallow wells close to the river for bathing and laundry, and deeper wells further up the incline and away from the river for drinking.</p>
